Understanding the genomic heterogeneity of tumors is an important task in computational oncology, especially in the context of finding personalized treatments based on the genetic profile of each patientâ€™s tumor. Tumor clustering that takes into account the temporal order of genetic events, as represented by tumor mutation trees, is a powerful approach for grouping together patients with genetically and evolutionarily similar tumors and can provide insights into discovering tumor sub-types, for more accurate clinical diagnosis and prognosis. 

We propose **oncotree2vec**, a method for clustering tumor mutation trees by learning vector representations of mutation trees that capture the different relationships between subclones in an unsupervised manner. Learning low-dimensional tree embeddings facilitates the visualization of relations between trees in large cohorts and can be used for downstream analyses, such as deep learning approaches for single-cell multi-omics data integration.
